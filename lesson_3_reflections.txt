When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The most common reason would be to allow multiple access to the repository from different workstations and even from different contributors.
This should include projects that needs to be worked on by a number of individuals or something that are made public for open source.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A manual system is preferable due to the public nature of most Git repositories. Updating automatically can cause 
changes to our branch that might clash with the work that has been done in our local repository.
