What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git bash creates a hidden folder named .git which will contain the metadata of the commits that are
done to the project.

This is required to allow the tracking of the updates that will be saved in the form of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area determines the files that will be included in a commit. It is different from the working
directory and the repository in that it is a temporary area which does not exist in a concrete manner.

It is useful when we are only making changes to certain files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I believe this can be done by comparing the changes done in the working area with the staging area 
then further comparing it with the changes done in the previous commit to make sure that the changes are
the ones we have in mind.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

It should help when we make branches that are clearly defined to test out different directions that the program can take.
This branching method will also allow us to see the different updates that might be planned and the ones that are implemented.
